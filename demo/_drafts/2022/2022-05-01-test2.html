<p>
  Plugins <b>may</b> receive variables as arguments, if they are enclosed in double curly braces.
</p>

{% assign page_variable = "assigned to a page variable" %}

{% block_tag_template param1="provided as string to plugin"
                      param2='{{page_variable}}'
                      param3="{{front_matter_variable}}"
                      param4='{{page.last_modified_at}}'
                      param5='{{layout.compress}}' %}
  This is the block_tag_template content.
  {{front_matter_variable}}
{% endblock_tag_template %}

<p>
  Includes may receive variables as arguments, but they must not be enclosed in double curly braces:

{% include block_tag_template_wrapper param2=page_variable param3=front_matter_variable %}
