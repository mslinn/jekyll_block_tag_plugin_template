===========

**TODO After cloning this repo, run `bin/run_this_first`, after which this line will automatically be deleted.**

`jekyll_block_tag_plugin_template` is a Jekyll plugin that provides a new Liquid tag called `new_tag_name` and a new tag block called `new_tag_block_name`.
The plugin is packaged as a Ruby gem.

 * A `new_tag_block_name` block tag that can do magic with its eyes closed.
   ```
   {% new_tag_name [arguments] %}
   Contents of new_tag_block_name
   {% endnew_tag_name %}
   ```
 * A `new_tag_name` tag that can turn on a dime and leave 15 cents change.
   ```
   {% new_tag_name Contents of new_tag_name tag%}
   ```

### Build and Push to RubyGems
To release a new version,
  1. Update the version number in `version.rb`.
  2. Commit all changes to git; if you don't the next step might fail with an unexplainable error message.
  3. Run the following:
     ```shell
     $ bundle exec rake release
     ```
     The above creates a git tag for the version, commits the created tag,
     and pushes the new `.gem` file to [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org).
